## Installation

You just need to download the RNAdvisor docker image using:

```bash
docker pull sayby77/rnadvisor:latest
```

## Data

The data is available in the `docker_data` folder. 
It is composed of two folders: `input` and `output`.
The `input` folder contains the input files for the RNAdvisor tool (with the native file and prediction files).
The `output` folder contains the output files generated by the RNAdvisor tool.


## Usage

You can either use RNAdvisor using the command line with the configuration file or using the python code.

### Configuration file

To run the RNAdvisor tool using the configuration file, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}/docker_data/:/app/docker_data \
-v ${PWD}/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \ 
sayby77/rnadvisor --config_path=./config.yaml
```


### Python file

To use RNAdvisor using the python code, you can use the following command:

```bash
python src/score_computation.py
```

In any case, it will save the results in the `docker_data/output` folder.
